Special tag constant representing all resources.

comprehensive resource selection is required.

Default tag constant for resources without explicit tagging.

Resources with this tag are considered publicly accessible or uncategorized common resources.
Typically used for system-level or public resources that don't require 
specific categorization.

Active state tag constant.

Used to mark resources that are currently active and available for use.
Commonly used in resource management systems to distinguish between 
available and unavailable resources based on their operational status.

INACTIVE: Tag = "__inactive__"
"""
Inactive state tag constant.

Used to mark resources that are currently inactive or temporarily unavailable.
Helps with state management and lifecycle control of resources, 
allowing systematic handling of dormant or disabled resources.

    Enumeration defining strategies for matching multiple tags when querying or filtering resources.

    These strategies control how tag-based filters apply logical operations
    between multiple tag conditions.
    """
    ALL = "all"
    """
    Full match strategy: Resource must contain ALL specified tags.

    Example: When querying resources with tags ["A", "B"], only resources that 
             contain both tag A AND tag B will be matched.

    Use case: Suitable for precise filtering scenarios where multiple 
              conditions must be simultaneously satisfied.

    Partial match strategy: Resource must contain ANY of the specified tags.

    Example: When querying resources with tags ["A", "B"], resources containing 
             either tag A OR tag B will be matched.

    Use case: Suitable for broad filtering scenarios where meeting any 
              condition is sufficient.

    """
    MERGE = "merge"

    Merge strategy: Combine new tags with existing tags, removing duplicates.

    When this strategy is applied:
    - New tags are unioned with existing tags
    - Duplicate tags are automatically deduplicated
    - Tag order is not guaranteed to be preserved

    Example: If a resource has existing tags ["A", "B"] and new tags ["B", "C"] 
             are merged, the result will be ["A", "B", "C"] (duplicate "B" is removed).

    Use case: When you want to add new tags to a resource without removing 
              existing tags, maintaining accumulated tag history.
    """

    REPLACE = "replace"
    """
    Replace strategy: Completely replace all existing tags with new tags.

    When this strategy is applied:
    - All existing tags are removed
    - New tags become the complete set of tags for the resource
    - This effectively resets the resource's tagging state

    Example: If a resource has existing tags ["A", "B", "C"] and new tags ["X", "Y"] 
             replace them, the result will be ["X", "Y"] (previous tags are completely removed).

    Use case: When you need to completely redefine a resource's tags, 
              such as during reclassification or ownership changes.
