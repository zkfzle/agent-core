Controller configuration module.

This module defines configuration-related classes for the controller:

class ControllerConfig(BaseModel):
    """Controller configuration.

    Defines configuration parameters for the controller and controls its behavior.
    The configuration items are grouped into several categories: task scheduling,
    task management, event queue, and intent recognition.

    Attributes:
        # ==================== Task scheduling configuration ====================
        max_concurrent_tasks: Maximum number of concurrent tasks, controlling the
                             upper limit of tasks executed at the same time.
                             Defaults to 5. A value of 0 means no limit.
        schedule_interval: Task scheduling interval in seconds. The scheduler
                           periodically scans pending tasks using this interval.
                           Defaults to 1.0 seconds. Smaller values improve
                           responsiveness but increase CPU usage.
        task_timeout: Task timeout in seconds. Tasks that exceed this duration are marked as failed.
                     Defaults to None, meaning no timeout.

        # ==================== Task management configuration ====================
        default_task_priority: Default task priority. Used when a task is created without an explicit priority.
                               Defaults to 1. Larger numbers indicate higher priority.
        enable_task_persistence: Whether to enable task persistence. When enabled, task states are stored for recovery.
                                 Defaults to False.

        # ==================== Event queue configuration ====================
        event_queue_size: Event queue size, limiting the number of events that can be stored in the queue.
                         Defaults to 10000. Not modifiable at runtime.
        event_timeout: Event processing timeout in seconds. Events that are not
                      processed within this time are discarded.
                      Default timeout is 120000.0 ms.

        # ==================== Intent recognition configuration ====================
        enable_intent_recognition: Whether to enable intent recognition. Defaults to True.
                                   When enabled, user intent is automatically recognized
                                   and routed to the corresponding handler.
        intent_confidence_threshold: Confidence threshold for intent recognition.
                                    Intents below this value are treated as UNKNOWN_TASK.
                                    Defaults to 0.7. Range 0.0–1.0.

    Example:
        ```python
        config = ControllerConfig(
            max_concurrent_tasks=10,
            schedule_interval=0.5,
            default_task_priority=5,
